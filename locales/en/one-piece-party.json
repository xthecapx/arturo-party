The wind calmed for a moment... but then another LIGHTNING!. Zoro drew his swords when he saw a GIANT WAVE coming. The ship went up and down, up and down. Chopper screamed scared because a new CYCLONE trapped us spinning round and round. Sanji almost lost his cigarette with so much LIGHTNING falling from the sky. Usopp hid when another GIANT WAVE passed. Finally Nami saw the island in the distance! But first we had to pass one last CYCLONE... We made it! Captain Luffy shouted with all his might: DROP ANCHOR!
